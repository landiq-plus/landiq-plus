## Using This Documentation

Each markdown file focuses on a specific aspect of the application design. The documentation is designed to be both:

1. A planning document for initial development
2. A reference for ongoing maintenance
3. An onboarding resource for new developers

## Versioning

This is version 1.0 of the planning documentation. As decisions are made and implementation proceeds, these files will be updated accordingly.
